1. Purpose St Leonard's College, its Principal and its staff owe a duty of care to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable risks of harm to the students (and/or persons) in their care, while they are involved in College activities, are present for the purposes of a College activity and when they are otherwise in the College environment, which in this policy means all physical, virtual and online School environments during or outside of school hours, including other locations provided for student use and those provided through third-party providers. In discharging duty of care responsibilities, the College and its teaching staff must exercise professional judgement to achieve a balance between ensuring that students do not face unreasonable risk of harm and encouraging students’ independence and maximising learning opportunities. Against each identified hazard, it is the College’s policy to develop risk controls and/or treatment plans. Risk controls often take the form of documented policies that are made available to all College staff. It is imperative that all staff consistently enforce College rules and safety policies, and actively engage in ensuring the physical and emotional wellbeing of students. This policy explains:

What the legal principle of “duty of care” means in a College setting; and

What the College, teachers and other staff need to do to meet their duty of care responsibilities.

2. Duty of Care Framework This policy is an overarching document that provides key elements of the College’s approach to support the College and its staff to meet their duty of care. This Policy forms part of the Duty of Care Framework and sets out the detailed policies, work systems, priorities and culture that St Leonard’s College is committed to build to achieve a safe environment.

3. Scope This policy applies to:

College Council;

Staff, volunteers and contractors whether or not they work in direct contact with students;

External education providers and Allied Health Providers; and

Ministers of Religion.

4. Introduction: What is a Duty of Care A duty of care is a legal obligation to avoid acts or omissions that could foreseeably lead to harm to another person. A breach of a duty of care that leads to harm to someone amounts to the tort of negligence. In Victoria, the law of negligence is governed by the Wrongs Act 1958, and by the Common Law. In broad terms, the legal position is that if a person is injured as a result of a negligent act or omission of another, the injured person would be able to claim under civil liability laws and seek compensation for loss and damages resulting from negligence. The existence of civil liability laws means that issues of liability for student care claims in Australia will ultimately be determined by a complex mixture of legislation and common law (judge’s decisions). To successfully bring a compensation claim in negligence, a person must establish on the balance of probabilities, that:

Page 2 of 9

A duty of care was owed to them at the time of the injury;

The risk of injury was reasonably foreseeable;

The likelihood of the injury occurring was more than insignificant;

There was a breach of the duty of care or a failure to observe a reasonable standard of care; and

This breach or failure caused or contributed to the injury, loss or damage suffered. Duty of care obligations are not absolute, or to ensure that no harm will ever occur, but a duty to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of harm occurring, meaning protection not only from known hazards, but also protection from harm that could foreseeably arise and against which preventative measures can be taken. The standard of care required is that of a “reasonable” person. This means that the duty of care owed is the duty one would expect from a hypothetical reasonable person with regular skills and attributes exercising their professional judgment. These laws limit liability in certain circumstances including, in broad terms:

The College does not owe a duty of care to warn of an “obvious risk”;

The College will not be liable for harm suffered as a result of the materialisation of an “inherent risk”;

and

However, the College and each staff member must ensure that ‘reasonable precautions’ are in place to

provide a quality standard of care. In Victoria since 1 July 2017, and only specifically in relation to child abuse claims, there is a 'presumption of liability' for Schools. This means that school staff need to prove that they took 'reasonable precautions' to prevent child abuse by an individual associated with the school.

### The duty of care is “non-delegable”

Duty of care is non-delegable meaning that it cannot be assigned to another party and duty of care responsibilities cannot be delegated or passed to another person or organisation. The College and its teachers continue to have duty of care responsibilities even when College activities are being undertaken and managed by third parties, volunteers and contractors or, for example, sports associations or transport providers. The legal term “non-delegable duty of care” is used to describe the duty of care responsibilities of Colleges and teachers. This legal concept underpins, and to a large extent drives, many of the College’s policies and practices. However, this does not mean that only one person holds a duty of care to a particular student at any one time. Multiple staff may have a duty of care to the same student, with differing responsibilities and roles to play in relation to the school discharging its overall duty of care. The precise scope of each staff member’s duty of care may be different. For example, a Principal is not required to personally supervise every student at lunchtime to discharge their duty but instead is responsible for establishing and monitoring a system for supervision that is shared amongst staff. Another staff member may be responsible for preparing the yard duty roster and each staff member rostered onto yard duty will have a duty of care to take reasonable steps in relation to any foreseeable risks to students arising at lunchtime which may include:

Monitoring specific students where there are known risks;

Generally monitoring all students and intervening where there is inappropriate student behaviour; and

Responding to accidents and taking appropriate measures to follow up any incidents that have

occurred, which may involve ensuring that the incident is reported to another staff member with

responsibility for further action.

5. Policy Statement Duty of Care applies whenever the students are under the authority and control of the College or its teachers. including during campus and off campus activities, camps, excursions, sports activities, playground activities and both before and after College when students are present on the College campus. The duty of care means:

To ensure that all staff and volunteers who supervise students need to understand that the College

and its teachers owe a duty of care to our students and make sure that they speak and act

appropriately including supervising, controlling and directing students, as required, to ensure that the

College meets its duty of care responsibilities.

To take reasonable measures, with regards to all circumstances, to protect students from risks of harm

and injury that should have been reasonably foreseen; This requires not only protection from known

hazards, but also protection from harm that could foreseeably arise and against which preventative

measures can be taken.

To take reasonable care that any student (and any other person) on the premises will not be injured or

damaged because of the state of the premises, including things done or omitted to be done to the

premises.

To take reasonable precautions to prevent the abuse of a child by an individual associated with the

College while the child is under the care, supervision or authority of the College.

That the College acknowledges that different and sometimes greater measures may need to be taken

for younger students or students with disabilities to discharge this duty of care as they require more

care and may be exposed to higher levels of risk. The College will ensure that particular management

and safety plans are in place for each respective student with extra needs and/or vulnerabilities of

diverse student groups or individual circumstances. To undertake an assessment of the risks of harm and injury and ensuring that measures are put in place to prevent those risks of harm from materializing.

### Standard of Care – Teaching Staff

The duty owed by the College and by our teachers is to take reasonable care: the standard of care that a reasonable teacher would take to prevent harm and injury. This means that the duty of care owed is the duty one would expect from a hypothetical teacher with teaching skills and attributes exercising their professional judgement. It is not a duty to ensure that no harm will ever occur, but a duty to provide reasonable care to avoid harm being suffered or foreseeable risk of injury. Individual teachers can be sued if they fail in their duty of care as a result of their negligence. It can be argued that the standard of care required of a teacher is greater than that expected of a parent or guardian, given that a teacher is a trained professional educationalist. The law expects a teacher to act as an ‘ordinary, reasonable’ educator rather than a ‘good and careful’ parent or guardian.

### Standard of Care – Non-Teaching Staff, Volunteers & External Providers

The requirement to take reasonable steps to reduce the risk of reasonably foreseeable harm, continues even when another party is involved (for example, a third-party providing services for an excursion or College camp). Non-teaching staff, volunteers (including parent volunteers), contractors and external providers (onsite) also owe a modified duty of care to protect students from risks of harm that ought reasonably to be foreseen. This duty only exists when the duty is consciously passed from a teacher to a non-teaching staff member, volunteer

Page 4 of 9 or provider, and accepted by that individual. A common example of where a teacher asks a non-teaching staff member to accompany a student to a different area of the College.

### What is Reasonable

The duty of care is framed in terms of taking reasonable care to protect students from harm. The word ‘reasonable’ is not defined and is, in the end, a judgment made about the risk of harm. The College and our teachers must ensure that they have identified the foreseeable risks of harm associated with all College activities and taken such measures as a reasonable teacher (or reasonable College) would take to prevent the harm of injury from occurring. “College activities’ includes academic and non-academic activities, inside the classroom and outside the classroom, sports and physical education, excursions, extra curricular and cocurricular activities, camps and outdoor education activities. All these activities require that the foreseeable risks of harm are identified and measures put in place to prevent those risks from occurring. Teachers and other staff, including volunteers, must ensure they understand the measures that are in place to prevent the harm from occurring and make sure these measures are effectively implemented. Judgement of what is reasonable care may be made by conducting a formal or informal risk assessment, which should be documented. What is reasonable will vary depending on the individual circumstances. Factors that should be considered when deciding what is reasonable in all the circumstances include:

The vulnerability of the student(s), for example, in relation to age, cultural background or students with

a disability;

Medical conditions: special care must be taken to protect students with medical conditions that are

known or ought to be known, and which expose them to a higher risk of injury (e.g. asthma or

epilepsy);

Behavioural characteristics: the level of care is increased where students are known to behave in a

manner that increases the risk of injury;

How the benefits of the activity or situation are balanced with the risk of the activity being harmful.

For example, the College may consider that the benefit of a water sports activity outweighs the risk of

injury to a student;

The nature of hazards present: increased care is required if the College activity has an inherently high

level of risk of injury or the activity takes place in a hazardous environment;

Any conflicting responsibilities the College or teacher may have. The extent to which a duty of care for

one group of students conflicts with a duty of care to another group of students;

The cost, difficulty or social impact of taking a particular action. For example, the social impact of

minute-by-minute close supervision, whilst designed to reduce the likelihood of injury, could be

considered overly protective;

Normal practices and procedures within the College;

Whether or not it is likely that harm will occur if a different action—or no action—is taken;

Whether or not the harm might be foreseen;

The potential seriousness of the harm that could occur. These factors should be taken into account when planning student activities.

a student that is currently enrolled at the College “Adverse Event”

includes an accidental drug overdose or other accidental action that may have resulted in the

Student’s death but did not. Common examples of adverse events that aﬀect Students

include accidents (such as traﬃc, car or physical accidents), assault (including physical or

sexual assault, mugging or robbery, or family violence), and witnessing something terrible

happen.

“Attempt” refers to a Student deliberately harming themselves with the intent to die but not

resulting in death.

“Incident” refers to an Attempt, NSSI or an Adverse Event.

“NSSI” or “Non-suicidal self-injury” is a deliberate act to harm oneself without the intent to

die, usually to reduce uncomfortable or distressing emotions and often repetitive in nature.

NSSI can be referred to as self-harm (the term deliberate self-harm is also used by health

care professionals). “Actionable Matter”

means any actual or alleged event or situation that:

  a) causes harm or creates a risk of causing harm to a Student’s health, safety and wellbeing either directly or indirectly while under the care or supervision of the College, including international students;
  b) impacts a student and is brought to the attention of the College, regardless of when or where it occurred, provided it is impacting on the Student or other Students within the College environment; or
  c) is otherwise reportable under one of the College’s policies relating to child safety, including but not limited to the child safety policy, the child safety code of conduct and the reportable conduct procedure.
