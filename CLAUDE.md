# Shogun

## Why This Project Exists

Shogun is a demonstration project being built to prove technical capability to Arjun Chopra, a Silicon Valley VC (Floodgate partner) who is assembling a team to build an AI-powered travel industry roll-up. The venture has three interlocking entities:

- **O1** — A hybrid PE/VC investment firm (similar to General Catalyst's model) that acquires travel management companies already entrenched in the industry.
- **Spotnana** — A modern cloud-native travel infrastructure platform ($100M+ raised) that replaces legacy GDS systems with APIs. Acquired companies get migrated onto Spotnana.
- **Shogun (the AI task force)** — A "Palantir for Travel" that deploys Forward Deployed Engineers into acquired companies to automate their workflows using AI. This is the entity I'm building toward joining.

The business thesis: Travel management companies run on **30% manual workflows**. A $600M revenue TMC at 10% margin earns $60M profit — but if you automate even half the manual work, margin jumps to 15%+ ($90M). The play is to acquire these companies (which have regulatory moats like IATA/ARC accreditation), migrate them onto Spotnana, and deploy AI agents to automate operations.

## What I'm Demonstrating

An engineer they hired from Amazon impressed Arjun by spending a weekend building an agent that ingests travel compliance data and constructs an ontology graph from it. I need to demonstrate the same kind of initiative — but go further. Instead of just parsing a document into a graph, this project shows the full pipeline:

1. **Ingest** a real corporate duty of care policy document (PDF)
2. **Extract** a complete ontology graph — entities, relationships, attributes — that captures every rule, threshold, role, definition, and procedure
3. **Reason** over the graph using an AI agent with tool-use that traverses the graph programmatically (not just dumping text into a prompt)
4. **Evaluate** the quality of both the graph and the agent's answers against a ground-truth test set

The sophistication matters because this mirrors what Shogun would actually deploy: take messy, unstructured policy documents from acquired TMCs and turn them into structured knowledge that agents can act on. If I can demonstrate this on duty of care policies, the same pattern extends to booking rules, fare rules, expense policies, and the PNR disruption workflows that are the core business opportunity.

## The Bar

Arjun specifically praised the Amazon engineer's initiative. The bar is not "interesting prototype" — it's "this person clearly understands the domain, the technical challenges, and can build production-quality tooling." Every piece of this project should reflect that standard.

## Project Structure Conventions

### PDF Parsers

We maintain two PDF-to-markdown parsers. **Parser 1 is the active parser** used by the pipeline (`src/pdf_parser.py`).

- `src/pdf_parser.py` — Parser 1 (custom heuristic, font-metric analysis via raw PyMuPDF). Handles bold ALL-CAPS heading detection, page number stripping, repeated header/footer removal, TOC dot-filler removal, cover page logic, definition formatting, and paragraph joining. **This is imported by `src/main.py`.**
- `src/pdf_parser_1.py` — Named copy of Parser 1 for reference.
- `src/pdf_parser_2.py` — Parser 2 (pymupdf4llm wrapper). Better at tables, links, and italic preservation, but misses body-size bold headings and does not strip noise.

### Parsed Output Organization

Each parser writes its markdown output to its own subfolder under `data/`:

- `data/parser_1/` — Markdowns generated by Parser 1
- `data/parser_2/` — Markdowns generated by Parser 2

Source PDFs live in `data/` root. Do not mix parser outputs into the same folder.

## Core Principles

- **Accuracy over cost.** Never accept a worse outcome to save tokens or reduce API calls. If the agent needs more iterations, let it iterate.
- **Enterprise-grade quality.** Every decision should be evaluated as: "Would this hold up at scale with high-stakes compliance documents where errors have real consequences?"
- **No shortcuts.** If a more robust solution exists — even if harder to implement — that is the correct choice.
- **Correctness first, then performance.** A fast wrong answer is worthless. A slower correct answer is the standard.
