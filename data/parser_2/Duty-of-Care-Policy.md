# **1. Introduction**

All environments around the world hold an inherent threat. Wherever we are as
individuals, we will be at some level or risk. Political, socio-economic and other
factors, combined with 3ie’s mission and activities, which are carried out from
both low-risk stable settings as well as high-risk and highly unstable and risky
country contexts, contribute to shifting dynamics that may present violence,
insecurity and disorder.

These dynamics may directly impact the physical and mental health of our
employees and associated individuals. This policy has been designed to minimise
the impact on 3ie’s employees and associated individuals, and the organization’s
reputation, finances and sustainability. It outlines our approach to our duty of care
responsibilities by providing essential principles of good practice at each stage
of the employment cycle with a specific focus for roles working or travelling to
complex and higher risk countries and also advises ways of working that we
expect our grantees, downstream partners and other contractors to exercise.

This policy applies to 3ie staff, and associated individuals (grantees and their
staff, consultants or other contractors, board members, volunteers and interns)

# **2. Statement of commitment**


3ie considers the security and wellbeing of all employees and associated individuals
very seriously and fully accepts the duty to provide a reasonably good standard of
care to those performing activities on 3ie’s behalf. Our duty of care is implemented
through the reasonable and practicable measures we use to ensure the physical
safety and psychological wellbeing of those associated with us personnel.

3ie commits to have and keep updated a combination of policies, procedures,
activities and practices that support effective implementation of these
commitments. Employees and associated individuals have the responsibility to
follow 3ie policies and procedures and exercise reasonable self-care and selfresponsibility.

Duty of Care is a legal and ethical obligation and a social contract between the
organisation, its employees and associated individuals, whether in the office,
working remotely from home, in a field location, in a foreign country or in one’s
own country. To reduce the likelihood of injury, trauma or death, 3ie seeks to
actively manage all safety, security and wellbeing risks to reasonable levels.
This requires the equal engagement of all parties involved. In exceptional
circumstances, 3ie may engage in activities above our normal risk, and in
such cases, 3ie will assess the risk against our strategic objectives, and the
social impact that can be achieved by working with these risks.


# **3. Duty of care principles**

Our duty of care policy is informed and guided by the following principles:

**3.1 Safety and wellness are paramount**


The safety, security and wellbeing of our employees and associated individuals
is our highest priority and takes precedence over everything else, including 3ie’s
programs, operations, property and reputation. We will take all reasonable
measures to protect those working with us and manage risks through all aspects
of our operations. Our duty of care extends to our employees who work
remotely, whether from home or in hybrid environments and we are committed
to ensuring that they have access to the necessary tools and support systems to
perform their roles safely and effectively.

**3.2 Safeguarding**


3ie is committed to safeguard the wellbeing (both physical and mental) and
rights of children, young individuals, adults, and vulnerable adults, irrespective
of nationality, ethnicity, faith, gender, sexuality, culture or any other
characteristic protected by law.


We understand that there may be factors (e.g. gender, gender identity, ethnicity,
etc.) that can expose our employees and associated individuals to greater risks.
We commit to supporting each individual at increased risk by assessing the risk
and developing targeted risk mitigation and safeguarding measures.

**3.3 Equitable care**

3ie’s duty of care is a responsibility to all personnel without distinction regarding
type of position or discrimination for any reason. All associated with us for our
work will have available all reasonable support, resourced locally whenever
possible, to ensure it is appropriate to local conditions.


**3.4 Integrated risk management**

Organisation specific risk assessments and risk management is integral to our
project planning and implementation. Risk is dynamic and ever evolving so
ongoing updates are essential especially prior to travel, new or significant
activities or following major changes in the environment.


employer is responsible for the health and safety of their employees, including

**3.5 Shared Responsibility**

For our Duty of Care policies and practices to be effective in reducing the risks
to our employees and associated individuals, we must all share the responsibility


**3.6 Effective Communication**

We believe in communicating with our employees and associated individuals
in simple and accessible language to create a positive and accessible security
risk management and wellbeing culture. This includes providing access to
information about the risks that they may face during the work, to empower
them to make informed decisions to consent or decline them. No employee or
associated individual must ever be forced or coerced into accepting more risk
than they are personally comfortable with

# **5. Critical Incident management**

A critical incident as an event out of the range of normal experience – one which
is sudden and unexpected, involves the perception of a threat to life and can
include elements of physical and emotional loss. Such events could manifest in
the form of (but not limited to) serious violence, rioting, abduction, fire and
natural calamities. Often such events are sufficiently disturbing to overwhelm, or
threaten to overwhelm, a person’s coping capacity. Most people would be
severely shaken by a critical incident but are likely to recover from its impact
with appropriate support.


Through the critical incident management procedure, 3ie ensures an
appropriate mechanism for the effective management of any incident and crisis.
# **6. Reporting and Governance**

3ie’s board and senior management are custodians of our values, which put
people first. They will ensure the policy and practice that supports duty of care
reflects 3ie’s values and are well-designed, well-managed and well-implemented.
