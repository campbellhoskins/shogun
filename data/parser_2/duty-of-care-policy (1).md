# Duty of Care Policy

**1.** **Purpose**


St Leonard's College, its Principal and its staff owe a duty of care to take reasonable steps to prevent
foreseeable risks of harm to the students (and/or persons) in their care, while they are involved in College
activities, are present for the purposes of a College activity and when they are otherwise in the College
environment, which in this policy means all physical, virtual and online School environments during or outside
of school hours, including other locations provided for student use and those provided through third-party
providers.


In discharging duty of care responsibilities, the College and its teaching staff must exercise professional
judgement to achieve a balance between ensuring that students do not face unreasonable risk of harm and
encouraging students’ independence and maximising learning opportunities.


Against each identified hazard, it is the College’s policy to develop risk controls and/or treatment plans. Risk
controls often take the form of documented policies that are made available to all College staff. It is imperative
that all staff consistently enforce College rules and safety policies, and actively engage in ensuring the physical
and emotional wellbeing of students.


This policy explains:


  - What the legal principle of “duty of care” means in a College setting; and

  - What the College, teachers and other staff need to do to meet their duty of care responsibilities.


**2.** **Duty of Care Framework**


This policy is an overarching document that provides key elements of the College’s approach to support the
College and its staff to meet their duty of care. This Policy forms part of the Duty of Care Framework and sets
out the detailed policies, work systems, priorities and culture that St Leonard’s College is committed to build to
achieve a safe environment.


**3.** **Scope**


This policy applies to:


  - College Council;

  - Staff, volunteers and contractors whether or not they work in direct contact with students;

  - External education providers and Allied Health Providers; and

  - Ministers of Religion.


**4.** **Introduction: What is a Duty of Care**


A duty of care is a legal obligation to avoid acts or omissions that could foreseeably lead to harm to another
person. A breach of a duty of care that leads to harm to someone amounts to the tort of negligence. In
Victoria, the law of negligence is governed by the _Wrongs Act 1958_, and by the _Common Law_ .


In broad terms, the legal position is that if a person is injured as a result of a negligent act or omission of
another, the injured person would be able to claim under civil liability laws and seek compensation for loss and
damages resulting from negligence. The existence of civil liability laws means that issues of liability for student
care claims in Australia will ultimately be determined by a complex mixture of legislation and common law
(judge’s decisions).


To successfully bring a compensation claim in negligence, a person must establish on the balance of
probabilities, that:

# Duty of Care Policy


  - A duty of care was owed to them at the time of the injury;

  - The risk of injury was reasonably foreseeable;

  - The likelihood of the injury occurring was more than insignificant;

  - There was a breach of the duty of care or a failure to observe a reasonable standard of care; and

  - This breach or failure caused or contributed to the injury, loss or damage suffered.


Duty of care obligations are not absolute, or to ensure that no harm will ever occur, but a duty to take
reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of harm occurring, meaning protection not only from known hazards,
but also protection from harm that could foreseeably arise and against which preventative measures can be
taken.


The standard of care required is that of a “reasonable” person. This means that the duty of care owed is the
duty one would expect from a hypothetical reasonable person with regular skills and attributes exercising their
professional judgment.


These laws limit liability in certain circumstances including, in broad terms:


  - The College does not owe a duty of care to warn of an “obvious risk”;

  - The College will not be liable for harm suffered as a result of the materialisation of an “inherent risk”;
and

  - However, the College and each staff member must ensure that ‘reasonable precautions’ are in place to
provide a quality standard of care.


In Victoria since 1 July 2017, and only specifically in relation to child abuse claims, there is a 'presumption of
liability' for Schools. This means that school staff need to prove that they took 'reasonable precautions' to
prevent child abuse by an individual associated with the school.


**The duty of care is “non-delegable”**


Duty of care is non-delegable meaning that it cannot be assigned to another party and duty of care
responsibilities cannot be delegated or passed to another person or organisation. The College and its teachers
continue to have duty of care responsibilities even when College activities are being undertaken and managed
by third parties, volunteers and contractors or, for example, sports associations or transport providers. The
legal term “non-delegable duty of care” is used to describe the duty of care responsibilities of Colleges and
teachers.


This legal concept underpins, and to a large extent drives, many of the College’s policies and practices.


However, this does not mean that only one person holds a duty of care to a particular student at any one time.
Multiple staff may have a duty of care to the same student, with differing responsibilities and roles to play in
relation to the school discharging its overall duty of care. The precise scope of each staff member’s duty of
care may be different. For example, a Principal is not required to personally supervise every student at
lunchtime to discharge their duty but instead is responsible for establishing and monitoring a system for
supervision that is shared amongst staff. Another staff member may be responsible for preparing the yard duty
roster and each staff member rostered onto yard duty will have a duty of care to take reasonable steps in
relation to any foreseeable risks to students arising at lunchtime which may include:


  - Monitoring specific students where there are known risks;

  - Generally monitoring all students and intervening where there is inappropriate student behaviour; and

  - Responding to accidents and taking appropriate measures to follow up any incidents that have
occurred, which may involve ensuring that the incident is reported to another staff member with
responsibility for further action.

# Duty of Care Policy

**5.** **Policy Statement**


Duty of Care applies whenever the students are under the authority and control of the College or its teachers.
including during campus and off campus activities, camps, excursions, sports activities, playground activities
and both before and after College when students are present on the College campus.


The duty of care means:


  - To ensure that all staff and volunteers who supervise students need to understand that the College
and its teachers owe a duty of care to our students and make sure that they speak and act
appropriately including supervising, controlling and directing students, as required, to ensure that the
College meets its duty of care responsibilities.

  - To take reasonable measures, with regards to all circumstances, to protect students from risks of harm
and injury that should have been reasonably foreseen; This requires not only protection from known
hazards, but also protection from harm that could foreseeably arise and against which preventative
measures can be taken.

  - To take reasonable care that any student (and any other person) on the premises will not be injured or
damaged because of the state of the premises, including things done or omitted to be done to the
premises.

  - To take reasonable precautions to prevent the abuse of a child by an individual associated with the
College while the child is under the care, supervision or authority of the College.

  - That the College acknowledges that different and sometimes greater measures may need to be taken
for younger students or students with disabilities to discharge this duty of care as they require more
care and may be exposed to higher levels of risk. The College will ensure that particular management
and safety plans are in place for each respective student with extra needs and/or vulnerabilities of
diverse student groups or individual circumstances.


To undertake an assessment of the risks of harm and injury and ensuring that measures are put in place to
prevent those risks of harm from materializing.


**Standard of Care – Teaching Staff**


The duty owed by the College and by our teachers is to take reasonable care: the standard of care that a
reasonable teacher would take to prevent harm and injury. This means that the duty of care owed is the duty
one would expect from a hypothetical teacher with teaching skills and attributes exercising their professional
judgement. It is not a duty to ensure that no harm will ever occur, but a duty to provide reasonable care to
avoid harm being suffered or foreseeable risk of injury. Individual teachers can be sued if they fail in their duty
of care as a result of their negligence.


It can be argued that the standard of care required of a teacher is greater than that expected of a parent or
guardian, given that a teacher is a trained professional educationalist. The law expects a teacher to act as an
‘ordinary, reasonable’ educator rather than a ‘good and careful’ parent or guardian.


**Standard of Care – Non-Teaching Staff, Volunteers & External Providers**


The requirement to take reasonable steps to reduce the risk of reasonably foreseeable harm, continues even
when another party is involved (for example, a third-party providing services for an excursion or College camp).


Non-teaching staff, volunteers (including parent volunteers), contractors and external providers (onsite) also
owe a modified duty of care to protect students from risks of harm that ought reasonably to be foreseen. This
duty only exists when the duty is consciously passed from a teacher to a non-teaching staff member, volunteer

or provider, and accepted by that individual. A common example of where a teacher asks a non-teaching staff
member to accompany a student to a different area of the College.


**What is Reasonable**


The duty of care is framed in terms of taking reasonable care to protect students from harm. The word
‘reasonable’ is not defined and is, in the end, a judgment made about the risk of harm.


The College and our teachers must ensure that they have identified the foreseeable risks of harm associated
with all College activities and taken such measures as a reasonable teacher (or reasonable College) would take
to prevent the harm of injury from occurring. “College activities’ includes academic and non-academic
activities, inside the classroom and outside the classroom, sports and physical education, excursions, extra
curricular and cocurricular activities, camps and outdoor education activities. All these activities require that
the foreseeable risks of harm are identified and measures put in place to prevent those risks from occurring.
Teachers and other staff, including volunteers, must ensure they understand the measures that are in place to
prevent the harm from occurring and make sure these measures are effectively implemented. Judgement of
what is reasonable care may be made by conducting a formal or informal risk assessment, which should be
documented.


What is reasonable will vary depending on the individual circumstances. Factors that should be considered
when deciding what is reasonable in all the circumstances include:


  - The vulnerability of the student(s), for example, in relation to age, cultural background or students with
a disability;

  - Medical conditions: special care must be taken to protect students with medical conditions that are
known or ought to be known, and which expose them to a higher risk of injury (e.g. asthma or
epilepsy);

  - Behavioural characteristics: the level of care is increased where students are known to behave in a
manner that increases the risk of injury;

  - How the benefits of the activity or situation are balanced with the risk of the activity being harmful.
For example, the College may consider that the benefit of a water sports activity outweighs the risk of
injury to a student;

  - The nature of hazards present: increased care is required if the College activity has an inherently high
level of risk of injury or the activity takes place in a hazardous environment;

  - Any conflicting responsibilities the College or teacher may have. The extent to which a duty of care for
one group of students conflicts with a duty of care to another group of students;

  - The cost, difficulty or social impact of taking a particular action. For example, the social impact of
minute-by-minute close supervision, whilst designed to reduce the likelihood of injury, could be
considered overly protective;

  - Normal practices and procedures within the College;

  - Whether or not it is likely that harm will occur if a different action—or no action—is taken;

  - Whether or not the harm might be foreseen;

  - The potential seriousness of the harm that could occur.


_These factors should be taken into account when planning student activities._
