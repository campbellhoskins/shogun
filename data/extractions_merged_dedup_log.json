When two entities are related but use different names, keep both and connect them with a relationship. Only merge when two extractions are truly the same entity appearing in different sections — same name, same real-world referent — where keeping both would create a meaningless exact duplicate.\n\nA redundant node with a relationship is always preferable to a lost query path. When in doubt, do NOT merge.\n\n---\n\n## MERGE LOGIC\n\nProduce a deduplicated list of entities. For every group of entities that are true duplicates, merge them into ONE entity. All other entities pass through with relationships added where appropriate.\n\n### When to Merge\n\nMerge two entities ONLY when ALL of the following are true:\n- Their names are the same or unambiguous abbreviations of each other (e.g., \"ED\" and \"Executive Director\")\n- Their descriptions refer to the same real-world role, object, or concept — not merely a related or overlapping one\n- Keeping both as separate nodes would create a meaningless exact duplicate with no distinct query value\n\n### When NOT to Merge\n\nDo NOT merge when:\n- Two entities use different terminology for the same or similar group (e.g., \"Employees\" and \"Personnel\") — instead, keep both and link with an `equivalent_to` relationship\n- One entity is an umbrella or collective term that contains the other (e.g., \"Representatives\" contains \"Consultants\") — instead, keep both and link with a `part_of` relationship\n- Two entities share a generic name (e.g., both called \"Policy\") but describe clearly different real-world things\n- You are unsure — false negatives (keeping duplicates) are always preferable to false positives (incorrectly merging distinct entities)\n\n### Relationships Between Non-Merged Entities\n\nWhen two entities are related but must remain separate, add a `relationships` entry to connect them:\n\n| Situation | Action | Relationship |\n|---|---|---|\n| Same name, same role, different sections | **Merge** | — |\n| Different name, same or similar group of people | **Keep both** | `equivalent_to` (on both entities, bidirectional) |\n| One entity is a named subcategory or member of another | **Keep both** | `part_of` (on the child, pointing to the parent) |\n| Unclear whether same or different | **Keep both** | Add relationship only if confident |\n\n### Conflicting Attributes\n\nIf merged entities have conflicting values for the same attribute key, keep both values as a list:\n```json\n\"effective_date\": [\"2023-01-01\", \"2023-04-03\"]\n```\nAnd note the conflict in the description.\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT SCHEMA\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array. No preamble, no explanation, no commentary outside the JSON.\n\nEvery entity in the array must follow this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"clean_lowercase_snake_case_id\",\n  \"type\": \"Definition\",\n  \"name\": \"Best most complete name\",\n  \"description\": \"Combined or original description\",\n  \"attributes\": {\"key\": \"value\"},\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\"target_id\": \"other_entity_id\", \"type\": \"equivalent_to | part_of\"}\n  ],\n  \"source_anchors\": [\n    {\"source_text\": \"EXACT verbatim quote from input\", \"source_section\": \"0\"}\n  ],\n  \"merged_from\": [\"original_id_1\", \"original_id_2\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Field Rules\n\n- **id**: Lowercase snake_case. Remove section prefixes (e.g., `s3_role_expense_limit` → `expense_limit`). If two non-merged entities would produce the same clean ID, append a disambiguating suffix (e.g., `policy_travel`, `policy_expense`).\n- **name**: For merged entities, pick the most specific and complete name. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **description**: For merged entities, combine descriptions using the pattern: \"[Most complete description]. [Unique facts from other sources not already covered].\" For pass-through entities, keep the original description verbatim — do not rewrite it.\n- **attributes**: For merged entities, take the union of all attribute keys. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **relationships**: Array of relationship objects. Use `equivalent_to` for entities that use different names for the same or similar group (add to both entities bidirectionally). Use `part_of` for entities that are a named member or subcategory of an umbrella entity (add only to the child, pointing at the parent). Empty array `[]` if no relationships apply.\n- **source_anchors**: Include ALL source references from all original entities. The `source_text` value must be copied character-for-character from the input. Do not paraphrase, truncate, or edit.\n- **merged_from**: Array of all original entity IDs that were merged. For pass-through entities, a single-element array.\n\n---\n\n## SELF-VERIFICATION\n\nBefore finalizing your output, verify:\n\n1. Every `source_text` value matches the input exactly — character for character\n2. Every original entity ID appears in exactly one `merged_from` array across the entire output\n3. The total count of original IDs across all `merged_from` arrays equals the total number of input entities\n4. No information from any original entity's description or attributes was lost\n5. No two output entities should themselves be merged (check your own output for remaining duplicates)\n6. Every `target_id` in a relationship points to an `id` that exists in your output\n7. All `equivalent_to` relationships are bidirectional (if A → B, then B → A)\n8. The JSON is syntactically valid\n",

    "thinking": "Let me analyze these entities to determine which should be merged and which should be kept separate with relationships.\n\nLooking at the entities:\n\n1. \"Activeness and Care\" (s1_value_activeness_care)\n2. \"Association and Cooperation\" (s1_value_association_cooperation)\n3. \"Responsibility and the Rule of Law\" (s1_value_responsibility_rule_of_law)\n4. \"Standards of Integrity and Professionalism\" (s1_standard_integrity_professionalism)\n5. \"Working Environment\" (s1_environment_working)\n6. \"Personnel\" (s2_definition_personnel)\n7. \"Representatives\" (s2_definition_representatives)\n8. \"Duty of Care\" (s4_def_duty_of_care)\n9. \"Breach\" (s4_def_breach)\n10. \"Reasonable Care\" (s4_def_reasonable_care)\n11. \"Reasonable Person\" (s4_def_reasonable_person)\n12. \"Risk\" (s4_def_risk)\n13. \"Harm\" (s4_def_harm)\n14. \"Injury\" (s4_def_injury)\n\nLooking at these, I don't see any obvious exact duplicates. Each entity has a distinct name and refers to different concepts, even though some are related.\n\nHowever, let me check for relationships:\n\n1. The three organizational values (Activeness and Care, Association and Cooperation, Responsibility and the Rule of Law) are all part of the same organizational values system but are distinct values.\n\n2. \"Reasonable Care\" and \"Reasonable Person\" are related - the \"Reasonable Person\" definition specifically mentions it should be \"Read in conjunction with Definition of Reasonable care\". This suggests they're closely related but distinct concepts.\n\n3. \"Duty of Care\" and \"Breach\" are related - Breach is specifically about breach of duty of care.\n\n4. \"Harm\" and \"Injury\" are related - Injury is a specific type of Harm.\n\n\n5. \"Personnel\" and \"Representatives\" represent different groups within the organization. All entities appear distinct with no exact duplicates, so I'll maintain them separately while establishing connections where they exist. I need to add relationships between \"Reasonable Person\" and \"Reasonable Care\" since they cross-reference each other, link \"Breach\" to \"Duty of Care\" as it defines violations of that duty, and establish that \"Injury\" is a subset of \"Harm\".\n\nFor the ID structure, I'm removing section prefixes to create cleaner identifiers: activeness_and_care, association_and_cooperation, responsibility_and_rule_of_law, standards_of_integrity_and_professionalism, working_environment, personnel, representatives, duty_of_care, breach, and reasonable_care.\n\nI'm establishing key relationships between these definitions: reasonable_person references reasonable_care since the description explicitly connects them, breach links to duty_of_care as it represents a violation of that duty, and injury is categorized as part_of harm since injuries constitute a type of harm. Now I'm formatting this into a structured JSON output with each definition including its id, type, name, description, attributes, relationships, and source anchors.\n\nThe first entry captures the foundational organizational values from section 1, specifically activeness and care as a core principle that underpins all NGO activities. I'll continue mapping each remaining definition systematically through the document, ensuring proper cross-references and source attribution.",

All other entities pass through with relationships added where appropriate.\n\n### When to Merge\n\nMerge two entities ONLY when ALL of the following are true:\n- Their names are the same or unambiguous abbreviations of each other (e.g., \"ED\" and \"Executive Director\")\n- Their descriptions refer to the same real-world role, object, or concept — not merely a related or overlapping one\n- Keeping both as separate nodes would create a meaningless exact duplicate with no distinct query value\n\n### When NOT to Merge\n\nDo NOT merge when:\n- Two entities use different terminology for the same or similar group (e.g., \"Employees\" and \"Personnel\") — instead, keep both and link with an `equivalent_to` relationship\n- One entity is an umbrella or collective term that contains the other (e.g., \"Representatives\" contains \"Consultants\") — instead, keep both and link with a `part_of` relationship\n- Two entities share a generic name (e.g., both called \"Policy\") but describe clearly different real-world things\n- You are unsure — false negatives (keeping duplicates) are always preferable to false positives (incorrectly merging distinct entities)\n\n### Relationships Between Non-Merged Entities\n\nWhen two entities are related but must remain separate, add a `relationships` entry to connect them:\n\n| Situation | Action | Relationship |\n|---|---|---|\n| Same name, same role, different sections | **Merge** | — |\n| Different name, same or similar group of people | **Keep both** | `equivalent_to` (on both entities, bidirectional) |\n| One entity is a named subcategory or member of another | **Keep both** | `part_of` (on the child, pointing to the parent) |\n| Unclear whether same or different | **Keep both** | Add relationship only if confident |\n\n### Conflicting Attributes\n\nIf merged entities have conflicting values for the same attribute key, keep both values as a list:\n```json\n\"effective_date\": [\"2023-01-01\", \"2023-04-03\"]\n```\nAnd note the conflict in the description.\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT SCHEMA\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array. No preamble, no explanation, no commentary outside the JSON.\n\nEvery entity in the array must follow this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"clean_lowercase_snake_case_id\",\n  \"type\": \"GovernanceBody\",\n  \"name\": \"Best most complete name\",\n  \"description\": \"Combined or original description\",\n  \"attributes\": {\"key\": \"value\"},\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\"target_id\": \"other_entity_id\", \"type\": \"equivalent_to | part_of\"}\n  ],\n  \"source_anchors\": [\n    {\"source_text\": \"EXACT verbatim quote from input\", \"source_section\": \"0\"}\n  ],\n  \"merged_from\": [\"original_id_1\", \"original_id_2\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Field Rules\n\n- **id**: Lowercase snake_case. Remove section prefixes (e.g., `s3_role_expense_limit` → `expense_limit`). If two non-merged entities would produce the same clean ID, append a disambiguating suffix (e.g., `policy_travel`, `policy_expense`).\n- **name**: For merged entities, pick the most specific and complete name. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **description**: For merged entities, combine descriptions using the pattern: \"[Most complete description]. [Unique facts from other sources not already covered].\" For pass-through entities, keep the original description verbatim — do not rewrite it.\n- **attributes**: For merged entities, take the union of all attribute keys. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **relationships**: Array of relationship objects. Use `equivalent_to` for entities that use different names for the same or similar group (add to both entities bidirectionally). Use `part_of` for entities that are a named member or subcategory of an umbrella entity (add only to the child, pointing at the parent). Empty array `[]` if no relationships apply.\n- **source_anchors**: Include ALL source references from all original entities. The `source_text` value must be copied character-for-character from the input. Do not paraphrase, truncate, or edit.\n- **merged_from**: Array of all original entity IDs that were merged. For pass-through entities, a single-element array.\n\n---\n\n## SELF-VERIFICATION\n\nBefore finalizing your output, verify:\n\n1. Every `source_text` value matches the input exactly — character for character\n2. Every original entity ID appears in exactly one `merged_from` array across the entire output\n3. The total count of original IDs across all `merged_from` arrays equals the total number of input entities\n4. No information from any original entity's description or attributes was lost\n5. No two output entities should themselves be merged (check your own output for remaining duplicates)\n6. Every `target_id` in a relationship points to an `id` that exists in your output\n7. All `equivalent_to` relationships are bidirectional (if A → B, then B → A)\n8. The JSON is syntactically valid\n",

All other entities pass through with relationships added where appropriate.\n\n### When to Merge\n\nMerge two entities ONLY when ALL of the following are true:\n- Their names are the same or unambiguous abbreviations of each other (e.g., \"ED\" and \"Executive Director\")\n- Their descriptions refer to the same real-world role, object, or concept — not merely a related or overlapping one\n- Keeping both as separate nodes would create a meaningless exact duplicate with no distinct query value\n\n### When NOT to Merge\n\nDo NOT merge when:\n- Two entities use different terminology for the same or similar group (e.g., \"Employees\" and \"Personnel\") — instead, keep both and link with an `equivalent_to` relationship\n- One entity is an umbrella or collective term that contains the other (e.g., \"Representatives\" contains \"Consultants\") — instead, keep both and link with a `part_of` relationship\n- Two entities share a generic name (e.g., both called \"Policy\") but describe clearly different real-world things\n- You are unsure — false negatives (keeping duplicates) are always preferable to false positives (incorrectly merging distinct entities)\n\n### Relationships Between Non-Merged Entities\n\nWhen two entities are related but must remain separate, add a `relationships` entry to connect them:\n\n| Situation | Action | Relationship |\n|---|---|---|\n| Same name, same role, different sections | **Merge** | — |\n| Different name, same or similar group of people | **Keep both** | `equivalent_to` (on both entities, bidirectional) |\n| One entity is a named subcategory or member of another | **Keep both** | `part_of` (on the child, pointing to the parent) |\n| Unclear whether same or different | **Keep both** | Add relationship only if confident |\n\n### Conflicting Attributes\n\nIf merged entities have conflicting values for the same attribute key, keep both values as a list:\n```json\n\"effective_date\": [\"2023-01-01\", \"2023-04-03\"]\n```\nAnd note the conflict in the description.\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT SCHEMA\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array. No preamble, no explanation, no commentary outside the JSON.\n\nEvery entity in the array must follow this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"clean_lowercase_snake_case_id\",\n  \"type\": \"Policy\",\n  \"name\": \"Best most complete name\",\n  \"description\": \"Combined or original description\",\n  \"attributes\": {\"key\": \"value\"},\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\"target_id\": \"other_entity_id\", \"type\": \"equivalent_to | part_of\"}\n  ],\n  \"source_anchors\": [\n    {\"source_text\": \"EXACT verbatim quote from input\", \"source_section\": \"0\"}\n  ],\n  \"merged_from\": [\"original_id_1\", \"original_id_2\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Field Rules\n\n- **id**: Lowercase snake_case. Remove section prefixes (e.g., `s3_role_expense_limit` → `expense_limit`). If two non-merged entities would produce the same clean ID, append a disambiguating suffix (e.g., `policy_travel`, `policy_expense`).\n- **name**: For merged entities, pick the most specific and complete name. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **description**: For merged entities, combine descriptions using the pattern: \"[Most complete description]. [Unique facts from other sources not already covered].\" For pass-through entities, keep the original description verbatim — do not rewrite it.\n- **attributes**: For merged entities, take the union of all attribute keys. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **relationships**: Array of relationship objects. Use `equivalent_to` for entities that use different names for the same or similar group (add to both entities bidirectionally). Use `part_of` for entities that are a named member or subcategory of an umbrella entity (add only to the child, pointing at the parent). Empty array `[]` if no relationships apply.\n- **source_anchors**: Include ALL source references from all original entities. The `source_text` value must be copied character-for-character from the input. Do not paraphrase, truncate, or edit.\n- **merged_from**: Array of all original entity IDs that were merged. For pass-through entities, a single-element array.\n\n---\n\n## SELF-VERIFICATION\n\nBefore finalizing your output, verify:\n\n1. Every `source_text` value matches the input exactly — character for character\n2. Every original entity ID appears in exactly one `merged_from` array across the entire output\n3. The total count of original IDs across all `merged_from` arrays equals the total number of input entities\n4. No information from any original entity's description or attributes was lost\n5. No two output entities should themselves be merged (check your own output for remaining duplicates)\n6. Every `target_id` in a relationship points to an `id` that exists in your output\n7. All `equivalent_to` relationships are bidirectional (if A → B, then B → A)\n8. The JSON is syntactically valid\n",

    "thinking": "Let me analyze these three policy entities to determine if they should be merged or kept separate:\n\n1. **s0_policy_duty_of_care**: \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY\" - This is specifically a duty of care policy document with approval date and order number\n2. **s2_policy_main**: \"Organization Policy\" - This refers to \"the main organizational policy document\" in terms of scope\n3. **s3_doc_policy**: \"Policy\" - This is \"the organizational policy document\" that provides understanding and safe working environment\n\nLet me check if these refer to the same real-world document:\n\n- s0 refers specifically to a \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY\" with specific approval date and order number\n- s2 refers to \"Organization Policy\" and talks about scope (\"applies to all staff and governance members\")\n- s3 refers to \"Policy\" and talks about purpose (\"provide clear understanding of policies, procedures and practices\")\n\nLooking at the source texts:\n- s0: \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY\" - this is clearly a title/header\n- s2: \"The policy applies to all staff and governance members of Organization (hereafter – named as Personnel).\" - this talks about the scope of \"the policy\"\n- s3: \"The purpose of this Policy is to provide the staff of the Personnel and Representatives with a clear understanding...\" - this talks about the purpose of \"this Policy\"\n\nThe key question is: are s2 and s3 referring to the same policy document as s0? \n\nLooking more carefully:\n- s0 is specifically titled \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY\" \n- s2 talks about \"the policy\" in context of scope\n- s3 talks about \"this Policy\" in context of purpose\n\nIt's quite possible that s2 and s3 are both referring to the same \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY\" document mentioned in s0, just from different sections that describe different aspects (scope and purpose).\n\nHowever, I need to be very careful here. The names are different:\n\n\n- \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY\" is a specific, formal title\n- \"Organization Policy\" and \"Policy\" are generic descriptors\n\nThe principle is clear: when entities use different names, keep them separate and connect with relationships rather than merging. Even if they might reference the same underlying document, the terminology used is distinct enough that I should maintain separate entities for \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY,\" \"Organization Policy,\" and \"Policy,\" then establish relationships between them to show how they connect. Looking at the descriptions more carefully, all three nodes characterize the same organizational policy document but emphasize different aspects—s0 focuses on duty of care obligations, s2 on scope definition, and s3 on staff understanding and safety. Since the extraction assigned them distinct names, I'll maintain them as separate nodes but establish equivalence relationships between them, particularly if s0 (the \"DUTY OF CARE POLICY\") is indeed the main policy that s2 and s3 reference. I'm confident these three segments all reference the same underlying duty of care policy document, so I'll establish equivalent_to relationships between them. For the IDs, I need to be more specific than generic terms like \"policy\" — s0 becomes duty_of_care_policy, s2 becomes organization_policy, and s3 becomes policy_staff_safety since it emphasizes creating a healthy and safe working environment. I'll link all three with equivalent relationships to reflect that they're describing different aspects of the same document.",

node in the graph. When two entities are related but use different names, keep both and connect them with a relationship. Only merge when two extractions are truly the same entity appearing in different sections — same name, same real-world referent — where keeping both would create a meaningless exact duplicate.\n\nA redundant node with a relationship is always preferable to a lost query path. When in doubt, do NOT merge.\n\n---\n\n## MERGE LOGIC\n\nProduce a deduplicated list of entities. For every group of entities that are true duplicates, merge them into ONE entity. All other entities pass through with relationships added where appropriate.\n\n### When to Merge\n\nMerge two entities ONLY when ALL of the following are true:\n- Their names are the same or unambiguous abbreviations of each other (e.g., \"ED\" and \"Executive Director\")\n- Their descriptions refer to the same real-world role, object, or concept — not merely a related or overlapping one\n- Keeping both as separate nodes would create a meaningless exact duplicate with no distinct query value\n\n### When NOT to Merge\n\nDo NOT merge when:\n- Two entities use different terminology for the same or similar group (e.g., \"Employees\" and \"Personnel\") — instead, keep both and link with an `equivalent_to` relationship\n- One entity is an umbrella or collective term that contains the other (e.g., \"Representatives\" contains \"Consultants\") — instead, keep both and link with a `part_of` relationship\n- Two entities share a generic name (e.g., both called \"Policy\") but describe clearly different real-world things\n- You are unsure — false negatives (keeping duplicates) are always preferable to false positives (incorrectly merging distinct entities)\n\n### Relationships Between Non-Merged Entities\n\nWhen two entities are related but must remain separate, add a `relationships` entry to connect them:\n\n| Situation | Action | Relationship |\n|---|---|---|\n| Same name, same role, different sections | **Merge** | — |\n| Different name, same or similar group of people | **Keep both** | `equivalent_to` (on both entities, bidirectional) |\n| One entity is a named subcategory or member of another | **Keep both** | `part_of` (on the child, pointing to the parent) |\n| Unclear whether same or different | **Keep both** | Add relationship only if confident |\n\n### Conflicting Attributes\n\nIf merged entities have conflicting values for the same attribute key, keep both values as a list:\n```json\n\"effective_date\": [\"2023-01-01\", \"2023-04-03\"]\n```\nAnd note the conflict in the description.\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT SCHEMA\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array. No preamble, no explanation, no commentary outside the JSON.\n\nEvery entity in the array must follow this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"clean_lowercase_snake_case_id\",\n  \"type\": \"Requirement\",\n  \"name\": \"Best most complete name\",\n  \"description\": \"Combined or original description\",\n  \"attributes\": {\"key\": \"value\"},\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\"target_id\": \"other_entity_id\", \"type\": \"equivalent_to | part_of\"}\n  ],\n  \"source_anchors\": [\n    {\"source_text\": \"EXACT verbatim quote from input\", \"source_section\": \"0\"}\n  ],\n  \"merged_from\": [\"original_id_1\", \"original_id_2\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Field Rules\n\n- **id**: Lowercase snake_case. Remove section prefixes (e.g., `s3_role_expense_limit` → `expense_limit`). If two non-merged entities would produce the same clean ID, append a disambiguating suffix (e.g., `policy_travel`, `policy_expense`).\n- **name**: For merged entities, pick the most specific and complete name. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **description**: For merged entities, combine descriptions using the pattern: \"[Most complete description]. [Unique facts from other sources not already covered].\" For pass-through entities, keep the original description verbatim — do not rewrite it.\n- **attributes**: For merged entities, take the union of all attribute keys. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **relationships**: Array of relationship objects. Use `equivalent_to` for entities that use different names for the same or similar group (add to both entities bidirectionally). Use `part_of` for entities that are a named member or subcategory of an umbrella entity (add only to the child, pointing at the parent). Empty array `[]` if no relationships apply.\n- **source_anchors**: Include ALL source references from all original entities. The `source_text` value must be copied character-for-character from the input. Do not paraphrase, truncate, or edit.\n- **merged_from**: Array of all original entity IDs that were merged. For pass-through entities, a single-element array.\n\n---\n\n## SELF-VERIFICATION\n\nBefore finalizing your output, verify:\n\n1. Every `source_text` value matches the input exactly — character for character\n2. Every original entity ID appears in exactly one `merged_from` array across the entire output\n3. The total count of original IDs across all `merged_from` arrays equals the total number of input entities\n4. No information from any original entity's description or attributes was lost\n5. No two output entities should themselves be merged (check your own output for remaining duplicates)\n6. Every `target_id` in a relationship points to an `id` that exists in your output\n7.

    "thinking": "Let me carefully analyze these entities to determine which should be merged vs. which should remain separate.\n\nLooking at the entities, they all appear to be different requirements/responsibilities from section 5 of a travel policy document. Let me examine them for potential merges:\n\n1. s5_requirement_physical_safety - Physical Safety Responsibility - about ensuring physical safety of personnel including in high-risk areas\n\n2. s5_requirement_org_info_security - Organization Information Security Responsibility - about ensuring information security of the organization including IP\n\n3. s5_requirement_personnel_info_security - Personnel Information Security Responsibility - about ensuring information security of personnel\n\n4. s5_requirement_material_assets - Material Assets Preservation Responsibility - about preserving material assets\n\n5. s5_requirement_financial_security - Financial Security Responsibility - about ensuring financial security\n\n6. s5_requirement_policy_compliance - Policy Compliance Responsibility - about ensuring policy compliance\n\n7. s5_requirement_reasonable_care - Reasonable Care and Duty of Care Responsibility - about taking reasonable care for own and others' health/safety\n\n8. s5_requirement_secure_environment - Secure Environment Participation Responsibility - about actively participating in building secure environment\n\n9. s5_requirement_risk_reporting - Risk Reporting Responsibility - about anticipating and reporting risks\n\n10. s5_requirement_risk_control - Risk Control Implementation Responsibility - about implementing preventative measures when risks identified\n\n11. s5_requirement_reasonable_care_standard - Reasonable Care Standard Responsibility - about taking care a reasonable person would expect\n\nNow let me look for potential merges:\n\nLooking at #7 (s5_requirement_reasonable_care) and #11 (s5_requirement_reasonable_care_standard):\n- #7: \"Reasonable Care and Duty of Care Responsibility\" - \"Taking reasonable care in the course of their work and accepting a duty of care for their own health and safety, as well as for the health and safety of others within the workplace\"\n- #11: \"Reasonable Care Standard Responsibility\" - \"Taking the amount of care a reasonable person would expect\"\n\n\nThese address distinct concepts—one focuses on workplace health and safety duties toward oneself and colleagues, while the other establishes a general standard of conduct. They should stay separate. Similarly, #2 and #3 clearly distinguish between organizational and personnel information security, so those remain distinct as well.\n\n#9 and #10 represent different stages of risk management: anticipating and reporting risks versus actually implementing preventative controls once identified. These warrant separate entries.\n\nNo duplicates emerge across the requirements—each addresses a unique responsibility dimension. I'll proceed with keeping all entities distinct and clean up the naming conventions by removing prefixes like s5_ and requirement_.\n\nFor the IDs, I need to handle the overlap between #7 and #11, both touching on reasonable care but from different angles. I'll differentiate them as reasonable_care_duty_responsibility and reasonable_care_standard_responsibility. Working through systematically: physical_safety_responsibility, org_info_security_responsibility, personnel_info_security_responsibility, material_assets_responsibility, financial_security_responsibility, policy_compliance_responsibility, reasonable_care_duty_responsibility, secure_environment_responsibility, risk_reporting_responsibility, risk_control_responsibility, and reasonable_care_standard_responsibility.\n\nLooking at potential connections between these responsibilities, information security responsibilities for the organization and personnel could share an equivalent relationship since they both address information protection but at different levels. The reasonable care concepts might relate to each other given their shared foundation. Risk reporting and risk control form a natural sequence within risk management processes.\n\nHowever, I'm uncertain whether these truly warrant relationship designations. The requirements are connected but fundamentally distinct in their scope and application. I'll hold off on adding relationships until I have stronger confidence in their validity.",

QUERYABILITY\n\nEvery distinctly-named entity that a user might search for must exist as its own node in the graph. When two entities are related but use different names, keep both and connect them with a relationship. Only merge when two extractions are truly the same entity appearing in different sections — same name, same real-world referent — where keeping both would create a meaningless exact duplicate.\n\nA redundant node with a relationship is always preferable to a lost query path. When in doubt, do NOT merge.\n\n---\n\n## MERGE LOGIC\n\nProduce a deduplicated list of entities. For every group of entities that are true duplicates, merge them into ONE entity. All other entities pass through with relationships added where appropriate.\n\n### When to Merge\n\nMerge two entities ONLY when ALL of the following are true:\n- Their names are the same or unambiguous abbreviations of each other (e.g., \"ED\" and \"Executive Director\")\n- Their descriptions refer to the same real-world role, object, or concept — not merely a related or overlapping one\n- Keeping both as separate nodes would create a meaningless exact duplicate with no distinct query value\n\n### When NOT to Merge\n\nDo NOT merge when:\n- Two entities use different terminology for the same or similar group (e.g., \"Employees\" and \"Personnel\") — instead, keep both and link with an `equivalent_to` relationship\n- One entity is an umbrella or collective term that contains the other (e.g., \"Representatives\" contains \"Consultants\") — instead, keep both and link with a `part_of` relationship\n- Two entities share a generic name (e.g., both called \"Policy\") but describe clearly different real-world things\n- You are unsure — false negatives (keeping duplicates) are always preferable to false positives (incorrectly merging distinct entities)\n\n### Relationships Between Non-Merged Entities\n\nWhen two entities are related but must remain separate, add a `relationships` entry to connect them:\n\n| Situation | Action | Relationship |\n|---|---|---|\n| Same name, same role, different sections | **Merge** | — |\n| Different name, same or similar group of people | **Keep both** | `equivalent_to` (on both entities, bidirectional) |\n| One entity is a named subcategory or member of another | **Keep both** | `part_of` (on the child, pointing to the parent) |\n| Unclear whether same or different | **Keep both** | Add relationship only if confident |\n\n### Conflicting Attributes\n\nIf merged entities have conflicting values for the same attribute key, keep both values as a list:\n```json\n\"effective_date\": [\"2023-01-01\", \"2023-04-03\"]\n```\nAnd note the conflict in the description.\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT SCHEMA\n\nOutput ONLY a JSON array. No preamble, no explanation, no commentary outside the JSON.\n\nEvery entity in the array must follow this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"clean_lowercase_snake_case_id\",\n  \"type\": \"Role\",\n  \"name\": \"Best most complete name\",\n  \"description\": \"Combined or original description\",\n  \"attributes\": {\"key\": \"value\"},\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\"target_id\": \"other_entity_id\", \"type\": \"equivalent_to | part_of\"}\n  ],\n  \"source_anchors\": [\n    {\"source_text\": \"EXACT verbatim quote from input\", \"source_section\": \"0\"}\n  ],\n  \"merged_from\": [\"original_id_1\", \"original_id_2\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Field Rules\n\n- **id**: Lowercase snake_case. Remove section prefixes (e.g., `s3_role_expense_limit` → `expense_limit`). If two non-merged entities would produce the same clean ID, append a disambiguating suffix (e.g., `policy_travel`, `policy_expense`).\n- **name**: For merged entities, pick the most specific and complete name. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **description**: For merged entities, combine descriptions using the pattern: \"[Most complete description]. [Unique facts from other sources not already covered].\" For pass-through entities, keep the original description verbatim — do not rewrite it.\n- **attributes**: For merged entities, take the union of all attribute keys. For pass-through entities, keep as-is.\n- **relationships**: Array of relationship objects. Use `equivalent_to` for entities that use different names for the same or similar group (add to both entities bidirectionally). Use `part_of` for entities that are a named member or subcategory of an umbrella entity (add only to the child, pointing at the parent). Empty array `[]` if no relationships apply.\n- **source_anchors**: Include ALL source references from all original entities. The `source_text` value must be copied character-for-character from the input. Do not paraphrase, truncate, or edit.\n- **merged_from**: Array of all original entity IDs that were merged. For pass-through entities, a single-element array.\n\n---\n\n## SELF-VERIFICATION\n\nBefore finalizing your output, verify:\n\n1. Every `source_text` value matches the input exactly — character for character\n2. Every original entity ID appears in exactly one `merged_from` array across the entire output\n3. The total count of original IDs across all `merged_from` arrays equals the total number of input entities\n4. No information from any original entity's description or attributes was lost\n5. No two output entities should themselves be merged (check your own output for remaining duplicates)\n6. Every `target_id` in a relationship points to an `id` that exists in your output\n7. All `equivalent_to` relationships are bidirectional (if A → B, then B → A)\n8. The JSON is syntactically valid\n",

The same approach applies to Personnel - I'll consolidate the duplicate entries across sections.\n\nThe Representatives role also appears in multiple sections and requires merging.

Both Representatives and Personnel share responsibility for adhering to the policy requirements detailed in section 5.\n\nA separate category encompasses persons directly engaged in implementing the policy itself, who bear distinct security and safety obligations tied to their implementation role.\n\nThe direct manager role is also identified as a key stakeholder—specifically the supervisor to whom employees must report unsafe conditions and behavioral concerns observed in the workplace. All 19 original entities are accounted for in the merged_from arrays with no data loss. The output contains no remaining duplicates, and every target_id mapping is present—employees and personnel reference each other bidirectionally, while all other roles (partners, suppliers, subgrantees, beneficiaries, stakeholders, consultants, external executors, engaged experts, volunteers, and other associated entities) correctly map to representatives.
