## Step 1: List all sections

1. **[Title/Approval Block]** - Preamble with approval signatures, location, date, and document title
2. **1. INTRODUCTION** - Sections 1.1 and 1.2 (note: document has two "1.2" entries - likely a typo, first should be 1.1)
3. **2. SCOPE** - Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
4. **3. AIM** - Sections 3.1, 3.2
5. **4. DEFINITIONS** - All defined terms
6. **5. DIRECTIONS OF ACTIVITY AND AREAS OF COMPETENCE** - Sections 5.1, 5.2
7. **6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND RIGHTS PROTECTION** - Header section
   - **Physical security** - Sections 6.1–6.8
   - **Non-Discrimination and equality** - Sections 6.9–6.11
   - **Protection against sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA)** - Sections 6.12–6.14
   - **Legal protection** - Sections 6.15–6.18
   - **Informational security** - Sections 6.19–6.25
   - **Security in emergencies** - Sections 6.26–6.28
8. **7. BREACHES OF THIS POLICY** - Sections 7.1, 7.2
9. **8. ASSESSMENT OF INCIDENT** - Sections 8.1, 8.2
10. **9. NOTIFICATION OF INCIDENT** - Section 9.1

## Step 2: Map hierarchical relationships

- [Title/Approval Block]: root level, no parent
- 1. INTRODUCTION: level 1, no parent
- 2. SCOPE: level 1, no parent
- 3. AIM: level 1, no parent
- 4. DEFINITIONS: level 1, no parent
- 5. DIRECTIONS OF ACTIVITY AND AREAS OF COMPETENCE: level 1, no parent
- 6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND RIGHTS PROTECTION: level 1, no parent
  - Physical security (subsection of 6): level 2, parent = 6
  - Non-Discrimination and equality (subsection of 6): level 2, parent = 6
  - Protection against sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) (subsection of 6): level 2, parent = 6
  - Legal protection (subsection of 6): level 2, parent = 6
  - Informational security (subsection of 6): level 2, parent = 6
  - Security in emergencies (subsection of 6): level 2, parent = 6
- 7. BREACHES OF THIS POLICY: level 1, no parent
- 8. ASSESSMENT OF INCIDENT: level 1, no parent
- 9. NOTIFICATION OF INCIDENT: level 1, no parent

## Step 3: Determine chunk boundaries

- **Chunk 0**: From document start through DUTY OF CARE POLICY title (approval block)
- **Chunk 1**: Section 1 INTRODUCTION (1.2 + 1.2, both paragraphs)
- **Chunk 2**: Section 2 SCOPE (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- **Chunk 3**: Section 3 AIM (3.1, 3.2)
- **Chunk 4**: Section 4 DEFINITIONS (all definitions)
- **Chunk 5**: Section 5 DIRECTIONS OF ACTIVITY AND AREAS OF COMPETENCE (5.1, 5.2)
- **Chunk 6**: Section 6 header + Physical security subsection (6.1–6.8) — this is a large section but tightly coupled; however it's quite long so I'll split it:
  - **Chunk 6a**: Section 6 header intro + Physical security (6.1–6.5)
  - **Chunk 6b**: Physical security continued (6.6–6.8)
- **Chunk 7**: Non-Discrimination and equality (6.9–6.11)
- **Chunk 8**: Protection against sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) (6.12–6.14)
- **Chunk 9**: Legal protection (6.15–6.18)
- **Chunk 10**: Informational security (6.19–6.25)
- **Chunk 11**: Security in emergencies (6.26–6.28)
- **Chunk 12**: Section 7 BREACHES OF THIS POLICY (7.1, 7.2)
- **Chunk 13**: Section 8 ASSESSMENT OF INCIDENT (8.1, 8.2)
- **Chunk 14**: Section 9 NOTIFICATION OF INCIDENT (9.1)

Actually, looking more carefully at the document structure:
- Section 6 has a header "## 6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND RIGHTS PROTECTION" and then subsections marked with "### Physical security", "### Non-Discrimination and equality", etc.
- The header of section 6 itself has no standalone content before the first subsection - it goes straight into "### Physical security"

Let me reconsider: The section 6 header text "## 6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND RIGHTS PROTECTION" and "## PROTECTION" appear to be part of the same header (spanning two lines). The subsections are labeled with ### headers.

For chunk boundaries:
- I'll make Section 6 header + Physical security as a chunk (since the header has no standalone content)
- Actually, looking at the structure, Physical security runs from 6.1 to 6.8 which is quite long (~3000 chars). I'll split into:
  - Chunk for Physical security 6.1-6.5
  - Chunk for Physical security 6.6-6.8

Wait, but the rules say "A section heading belongs with the content that follows it". Since 6.1-6.8 all fall under "### Physical security", let me keep them together if possible, or split at a natural boundary.

Let me count characters more carefully:
- 6.1-6.5: reasonably long with the bullet lists
- 6.6-6.8: also has content

I'll split physical security into two chunks: 6.1-6.5 and 6.6-6.8, with the section 6 header going with 6.1.

Actually, for cleanliness, I'll put the Section 6 main header together with the "### Physical security" heading and 6.1-6.5, then 6.6-6.8 as a continuation under physical security.

Let me reconsider the overall approach more carefully:

The document structure is:
- Section 6 (level 1): "RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND RIGHTS PROTECTION"
  - Subsection (level 2): "Physical security" → paragraphs 6.1-6.8
  - Subsection (level 2): "Non-Discrimination and equality" → paragraphs 6.9-6.11
  - Subsection (level 2): "Protection against sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA)" → paragraphs 6.12-6.14
  - Subsection (level 2): "Legal protection" → paragraphs 6.15-6.18
  - Subsection (level 2): "Informational security" → paragraphs 6.19-6.25
  - Subsection (level 2): "Security in emergencies" → paragraphs 6.26-6.28

The section 6 header itself has no standalone text content, so it needs to be paired with something. I'll pair it with the "Physical security" subsection header and its content. Since Physical security is quite long, I'll split it:
- Chunk: Section 6 header + "### Physical security" + 6.1-6.5
- Chunk: Physical security 6.6-6.8

For chunk numbering/section_number assignment:
- The "### Physical security" subsection doesn't have its own number, but its content is numbered 6.1-6.8. I'll use "6.1-6.5" and "6.6-6.8" as approximate section numbers, or better, treat "Physical security" as an unnumbered subsection of section 6.

Actually let me simplify: I'll treat the named subsections of section 6 as having section numbers based on their content paragraphs:
- Physical security: 6.1 through 6.8 → section_number "6" with subsection "Physical security"
- Non-Discrimination: 6.9 through 6.11
- etc.

For the section_number field, I'll use descriptive identifiers:
- "6" for the section 6 + physical security chunk(s)
- I'll split physical security into two chunks: first (6.1-6.5) and second (6.6-6.8)

Let me finalize the plan:

**Chunk 0**: [Title/Approval Block] - preamble
**Chunk 1**: Section 1 - INTRODUCTION
**Chunk 2**: Section 2 - SCOPE
**Chunk 3**: Section 3 - AIM
**Chunk 4**: Section 4 - DEFINITIONS
**Chunk 5**: Section 5 - DIRECTIONS OF ACTIVITY AND AREAS OF COMPETENCE
**Chunk 6**: Section 6 header + Physical security (6.1-6.5)
**Chunk 7**: Physical security continued (6.6-6.8)
**Chunk 8**: Non-Discrimination and equality (6.9-6.11)
**Chunk 9**: Protection against SEA (6.12-6.14)
**Chunk 10**: Legal protection (6.15-6.18)
**Chunk 11**: Informational security (6.19-6.25)
**Chunk 12**: Security in emergencies (6.26-6.28)
**Chunk 13**: Section 7 - BREACHES OF THIS POLICY
**Chunk 14**: Section 8 - ASSESSMENT OF INCIDENT
**Chunk 15**: Section 9 - NOTIFICATION OF INCIDENT

## Step 4: Verify complete coverage

Going through the document top to bottom:
- "Kiyv, 2023" through "# DUTY OF CARE POLICY" → Chunk 0 ✓
- "## 1. INTRODUCTION" through end of second 1.2 paragraph → Chunk 1 ✓
- "## 2. SCOPE" through end of bullet list in 2.3 → Chunk 2 ✓
- "## 3. AIM" through 3.2 → Chunk 3 ✓
- "## 4. DEFINITIONS" through end of Injury definition → Chunk 4 ✓
- "## 5. DIRECTIONS OF ACTIVITY AND AREAS OF COMPETENCE" through end of 5.2 bullet list → Chunk 5 ✓
- "## 6. RESPONSIBILITIES..." + "### Physical security" + 6.1-6.5 → Chunk 6 ✓
- 6.6-6.8 → Chunk 7 ✓
- "### Non-Discrimination and equality" + 6.9-6.11 → Chunk 8 ✓
- "### Protection against sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA)" + 6.12-6.14 → Chunk 9 ✓
- "### Legal protection" + 6.15-6.18 → Chunk 10 ✓
- "### Informational security" + 6.19-6.25 → Chunk 11 ✓
- "### Security in emergencies" + 6.26-6.28 → Chunk 12 ✓
- "## 7. BREACHES OF THIS POLICY" + 7.1-7.2 → Chunk 13 ✓
- "## 8. ASSESSMENT OF INCIDENT" + 8.1-8.2 → Chunk 14 ✓
- "## 9. NOTIFICATION OF INCIDENT" + 9.1 → Chunk 15 ✓

All sections covered. Now I'll write the JSON output.

For section numbers of the named subsections within section 6, I'll use:
- "6.A" for Physical security (6.1-6.5 part)
- "6.B" for Physical security continued (6.6-6.8 part)  
- Actually this is confusing. Let me use:
  - Chunk 6: section_number = "6", containing the header + Physical security header + 6.1-6.5
  - Chunk 7: section_number = "6.physical_security_cont" ... no that's too complex

Better approach: Since Physical security is a named subsection of 6, I'll treat it as the "main" content of section 6 and split it:
- Chunk 6: section_number = "6", level = 1, contains section 6 header + Physical security subheader + 6.1-6.5
- Chunk 7: section_number = "6.6", level = 2 (continuation of physical security, using the first paragraph number as identifier)

Actually, the cleanest approach given the document structure:
- Use the named subsection headers as the chunk headers for level 2 chunks
- For the split physical security, the first chunk gets the header "Physical security" and the second gets "[Physical security continued]"

Let me finalize section numbers:
- Chunk 6: header="RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND RIGHTS PROTECTION" + Physical security, section_number="6", level=1
  - Wait, but the Physical security is a subsection (###), so it should be level 2

I think the cleanest approach is:
- Chunk 6: The section 6 header paired with the Physical security subsection header and content 6.1-6.5. Since the section 6 header has no standalone content, this chunk is essentially level 1+2 combined. I'll set level=1 and note Physical security as a subsection.

Actually, let me just do it cleanly:
- Chunk 6: Section 6 header (no content) PLUS Physical security header and 6.1-6.5. Since I must pair the section 6 header with something (it has no standalone content), and the first thing after it is the Physical security subsection, I'll include the section 6 header in this chunk. I'll label this chunk with the Physical security header and note it's under section 6.
  - header: "Physical security"
  - section_number: "6" (treating it as the start of section 6)
  - level: 2

Hmm, but then I lose the section 6 header information. Let me just include section 6 header + Physical security header in one chunk, labeled at level 1 with the section 6 header, including everything through 6.5.

Final decision:
- Chunk 6: header="RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND RIGHTS PROTECTION", section_number="6", level=1, contains full header text + "### Physical security" heading + 6.1-6.5
- Chunk 7: header="Physical security (continued)", section_number="6.6", level=2, parent=6, contains 6.6-6.8
- Chunk 8: header="Non-Discrimination and equality", section_number="6.9", level=2, parent=6, contains 6.9-6.11
- Chunk 9: header="Protection against sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA)", section_number="6.12", level=2, parent=6, contains 6.12-6.14
- Chunk 10: header="Legal protection", section_number="6.15", level=2, parent=6, contains 6.15-6.18
- Chunk 11: header="Informational security", section_number="6.19", level=2, parent=6, contains 6.19-6.25
- Chunk 12: header="Security in emergencies", section_number="6.26", level=2, parent=6, contains 6.26-6.28

This seems the cleanest. Let me proceed with writing the JSON.

For Physical security section numbers: The actual section number for "Physical security" as a named subsection isn't numbered itself, but its content ranges from 6.1 to 6.8. I'll use "6.1" for the first physical security chunk and "6.6" for the continuation.

Wait - I realize I need to be more careful. The named subsections (Physical security, Non-Discrimination, etc.) don't have their own numbers - they're just named groupings. The paragraph numbers (6.1, 6.2, etc.) continue sequentially across these subsections. So:
- Physical security contains paragraphs 6.1-6.8
- Non-Discrimination contains paragraphs 6.9-6.11
- SEA contains paragraphs 6.12-6.14
- Legal protection contains paragraphs 6.15-6.18
- Informational security contains paragraphs 6.19-6.25
- Security in emergencies contains paragraphs 6.26-6.28

For the section_number field, I'll use:
- The named subsection combined with its first paragraph number
- Physical security (first part): "6.1" (first paragraph)
- Physical security (second part): "6.6" (starting paragraph)
- Non-Discrimination: "6.9"
- SEA: "6.12"
- Legal protection: "6.15"
- Informational security: "6.19"
- Security in emergencies: "6.26"

But since chunk 6 contains both the section 6 header and physical security, I'll use section_number="6" for it, and "6.6" for the continuation.

OK, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just write the JSON now with reasonable choices.
