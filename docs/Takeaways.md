# Takeaways from Call with Arjun

## Key Insights

### Riding the Wave of Technology
- Companies are leveraging AI to enter **Greenfield industries** by deploying models that can effectively take over manual workflows.
- Target industries include **customer service**, **market services**, and **manager services** — industries that are Greenfield because the critical barrier to entry is **regulation**, not technology.

### Why Travel is a Prime Target
- Travel is an especially effective Greenfield industry because you need **certification and accreditation** to issue airline tickets and hold credit to do so.
- It's not as simple as just building software — you must have the actual **ability to act** (i.e., issue tickets).
- This is why they **acquired Direct Travel**, which required significant capital but gives them the operational capability to execute.

### The 30% Manual Workflow Opportunity
- Currently, these travel companies have workflows that are **30% manual**.
- Tasks like checking bookings, validating itineraries, handling layover impacts, and processing changes are still done by hand.
- **Example economics**: A travel company making **$600M in revenue** at a **10% margin** earns **$60M in profit**. If 30% of costs are manual labor and you cut that down, you could shift the margin to **15%**, adding an enormous amount to profitability — a massive increase in business value.

### PNR (Passenger Name Record) Complexity
- A **PNR** is touched **over 50 times** from the point of booking to the point of arrival.
- If nothing changes (e.g., the flight arrives at the gate on time), no action is needed.
- But if a **flight is delayed by 30 minutes**, an agent would need to:
  - Determine if connecting flights are affected
  - Check if other aspects of the itinerary are impacted
  - Proactively take rebooking or rerouting actions
- This cascading decision-making is exactly where AI agents can replace manual processes.

### Ontology Graphs in Travel
- Arjun mentioned **ontology graphs multiple times** as a critical concept.
- The engineer they hired from Amazon built a project over a weekend where he:
  - Ingested **travel compliance data**
  - Built an agent that could **reason over it** and create an **ontology graph**
- This was seen as a very impressive initiative — taking an idea and actually building something tangible.

### Duty of Care
- **Duty of care** is a significant obligation placed on these travel companies.
- An agent could ingest a company's **duty of care policy**, evaluate situations, and determine whether the company is on the hook for certain outcomes.
- This is another area ripe for AI automation.

### Patent & Performance Product
- Arjun mentioned holding a **patent** in some sort of performance product that was sold to other companies.

## Organizational Structure

### The Three Entities & Their Flywheel

1. **O1** — The investment firm that Arjun is creating. Described as a hybrid entity between **private equity and venture capital** (similar to what **General Catalyst** has been doing — buying companies already entrenched in industries that are ripe for AI).

2. **Spotnana** — The company that provides **services and infrastructure** that other companies need in order to build a travel company on top of. Significant investment has been made here.

3. **Direct Travel** — An acquired company with **7,500 companies using it**, but only **100 of those companies** use Spotnana's more efficient workflows.

4. **Shogun** — Described as the **AI task force** that goes into all these companies and applies AI solutions.

- The synergy between these three (or four) entities creates a **flywheel** where each entity's success directly impacts the success of the others.

## Open Questions to Resolve

### Relationship Between Entities
- What is the exact relationship between **Spotnana**, **Direct Travel**, and the **TMCs (Travel Management Companies)** that use Direct Travel?
- Who is actually **issuing the airline tickets** — is it Direct Travel or the TMCs?
- Are the TMCs buying from Direct Travel and then using Spotnana workflows?
- Or is Direct Travel the accredited entity that issues tickets, with TMCs using Direct Travel's accreditation to sell and fulfill bookings?
- Which entities are dealing with the **mostly manual workflows**?
- When a TMC with manual workflows receives a flight change request, are they **coordinating with Direct Travel** to make those changes?

### Duty of Care Standards
- Are all TMCs held to the **same duty of care standard**?
- **Who determines** the duty of care requirements for these TMCs?

### Technical Deep Dives Needed
- Research **ontology graphs** and how they relate to travel compliance specifically.
- Understand how the Amazon engineer built an agent that ingests compliance policies and creates an ontology-based reasoning system.
- Research what a **PNR** is in detail and how it flows through the travel ecosystem.
- Investigate what data these travel agencies (like Direct Travel with its 75+ companies) actually work with.

## Action Items

1. **Learn the industry deeply** — Understand the travel management workflow end-to-end, especially the manual processes. This is the most important thing to earn credibility and admiration.

2. **Build something tangible** — Follow the example of the Amazon engineer. Find a specific part of the travel workflow that can be automated and **actually build it**. Take the initiative of learning about something and then demonstrating capability by doing it.

3. **Deep dive into travel agency data** — Understand what data flows through companies like Direct Travel and its 7,500 client companies.

4. **Research ontology graphs** — Specifically how they apply to travel compliance and how an agent can reason over compliance data using ontology structures.

5. **Understand PNRs** — Learn what a PNR is, how it's structured, how it's touched 50+ times, and where the manual intervention points are.

6. **Map the entity relationships** — Create a clear diagram of how O1, Spotnana, Direct Travel, TMCs, and Shogun interact and where value is created.

7. **Identify duty of care automation opportunities** — Understand duty of care policies and how an agent could ingest and reason over them.

## Personal Advice from Arjun

- When making a career change, **run towards something, not away from something**. Don't frame it as being unhappy — frame it as having found something compelling.
- The move should be to somewhere you think you can be **forever**.
- Taking initiative and actually building things (like the Amazon engineer did over a weekend) is what demonstrates value and earns respect.
